# myFirstJsProject

Created my very first project created using Javascript, HTML and CSS! The game is based off one of my favorite childhood shows, Avatar: The Last Airbender and rock, paper, scissors. Elementals take the place as rock, paper and scissors which can be played in the console. Go ahead and have a go!

Remember:

Water ğŸ’§  beats Fire ğŸ”¥ 

Fire ğŸ”¥  beats Earth ğŸª¨

Earth ğŸª¨ beats Water ğŸ’§
